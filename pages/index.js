              I am a SQL Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
              from City University London. I have over two years of experience
              as a back-end developer using C# and SQL.

              My passion for programming started during my university studies,
              where I was constantly challenged to find solutions and learn
              something new every day. Even after graduation, I continued to
              learn and expand my skills, currently focusing on Blockchain
              technology and related technologies such as Solidity, ReactJS,
              HTML5, CSS, and more.

              In my free time, I enjoy volunteering for charity, playing
              football, badminton, running, gaming, and listening to music.
